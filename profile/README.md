## Hello Student!

Welcome to the Ed Data Science EES Organisation. This is *not* a Repository, it's an Organisation - something GitHub offers that groups together people and repos. Everyone that's ever taken Data Science is part of this Organisation, we group you into Teams by year on the 'Teams' page. 

Why is this Organisation useful?
- It's how we (the teaching team) can keep track of who's on the course, and see assignment repositories for marking (other students' work is hidden from you, only visible to us)
- It's where you can keep track of your assignment repositories
- You as students can create Teams for working together if you want - look under the 'Teams' tab
- It's a quick way to access the 'Data Science Hub' repo for your year (it should show up under 'Repositories', below this ReadMe). This is the repository that contains all the teaching material for the semester, and where you can raise issues to ask questions of the teaching team. 

If you're having issues with accessing old repos in this organisation, email me, [Hannah Wauchope](hannah.wauchope@ed.ac.uk). 

**IMPORTANT** - We may have to clear out this organisation some day when there are too many repos! IF YOU WANT ACCESS TO YOUR WORK AFTER YOU FINISH THE COURSE, MAKE SURE YOU MOVE YOUR ASSIGNMENT REPOS TO YOUR OWN PERSONAL REPOSITORY.
This can be a mild faff, what you need to do is fork your assignment repo to your personal repo (click the 'fork' button, almost top right on the main page of the repo). Name your new fork something useful, keep 'copy the master branch only' ticked, click 'create fork'. Then follow the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/detaching-a-fork), you'll need to be [logged into your Git](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/git/) in terminal. Replace 'EXAMPLE-USER' with your username, and 'FORK' with the name of your forked repo.
